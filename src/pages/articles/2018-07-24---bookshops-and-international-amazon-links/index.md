##Buy from Real Bookshops

Support your local bookshope with the [hive] (https://www.hive.co.uk/). This cool website lets you buy books online which you can then collect from your local bookshop or have delivered to you.

##Promote kindle books internationally
 
If you're an author promoting your kindle eBook on Amazon, this clever site will  convert your amazon link into an international link that directs the viewer to their local Amazon store. The site is called [A-FWD](https://affiliate-geo-target.com/amazon.html) and you just put your amazon link in then press 'copy'  so that you  only need one link for your tweets or website, rather than the 'click here if you're a US customer.'

PS. I'm not published on Kobo, but apparently you can just  [edit the link directly](https://kobowritinglife.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007188808-Linking-to-your-eBook)
