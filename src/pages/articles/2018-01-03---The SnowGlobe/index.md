The time? Wednesday 28th February 2018, the place? The Globe theatre London. The weather? Freezing with snow. The event, the launch of  Single Sign On. 
 
Single Sign On is a project that Jisc and SCL have been working on together to allow customers to access eResources with just one login. Libraries have always tried to make borrowing books and accessing printed information as easy as possible, now it's time to do the same for all the fantastic resources and information that libraries provide over the Internet. It's taken longer than expected but, with the help and cooperation of publishers and the Library Software (LMS) companies, Single Sign On is ready to launch on April 2nd 2018
 
The conference was a great opportunity for librarians to find out more about Single Sign On and ask questions about how it would work for them.  There were some really useful contributions from library specialists, publishers and technology companies. Everyone who braved the snow was given   tour of  the theatre and the unforgettable memory of the Globe filled with falling snowâ€¦  

 
 
The two truths? 
That Single Sign On is ready to be used, and that Librarians are never far from a Shakespeare quote.
